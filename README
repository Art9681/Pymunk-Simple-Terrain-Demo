Requires Python, Pyglet, Cocos2D and noise libraries.

Run main.py to launch demo.

Notes:
- It takes a split second to generate the level! This is because it is all loaded into memory.
- Also lags a bit on quit.

Recent changes:
-Added basic collision model. Map blocks only have collision enabled on top segment for now. You can walk through the blocks but not fall through them.
- Added back ground color layer.
- Map is now divided between ground and sky.
- Created function that interpolates column height to create rolling hills horizon.
- Mouse scroll zooms in or out. Careful! Scrolling while you zoom out too much it will crash.
- Mouse click removes tile and triggers map redraw. (Pretty fast for the map size!)


TODO:
- Add developer menu.
- Add algorithm to generate pymunk segment colliders around terrain blocks.
- Limit zoom to prevent crash.
- Highlight tile on mouse hover.
- LEFT mouse click changes tile. RIGHT mouse click deletes tile.
- Add menu to select tiles or other items.
- Load level in chunks.

Older changes:
- Moar caves!
- Added scrolling background layer.
- Added input. W, A, S, D keys scroll level.

Removed:
- Mouse move returns position in world coordinates.
- Mouse click returns Cell texture id.
