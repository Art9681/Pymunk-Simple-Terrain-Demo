Requires Python, Pyglet, Cocos2D and noise libraries.

Run main.py to launch demo.

Notes:
- It takes a split second to generate the level! This is because it is all loaded into memory.
- Also lags a bit on quit.

Recent changes:
- Mouse scroll zooms in or out. Careful! Scrolling while you zoom out too much it will crash.
- Mouse click removes tile and triggers map redraw. (Pretty fast for the map size!)
- Moar caves!

TODO:
- Limit zoom to prevent crash.
- Highlight tile on mouse hover.
- LEFT mouse click changes tile. RIGHT mouse click deletes tile.
- Add menu to select tiles or other items.
- Add developer menu.
- Apply 1D noise to divide ground and sky.
- Load level in chunks.

Older changes:
- Added scrolling background layer.
- Added input. W, A, S, D keys scroll level.

Removed:
- Mouse move returns position in world coordinates.
- Mouse click returns Cell texture id.
